# Assignment-AP

This project is focused on implementing efficient caching mechanisms and smooth image loading within an iOS application. Using UICollectionView, it handles image loading with disk caching for optimized resource management. The project scope also includes potential optimizations to enhance user experience and performance.

Key Features

Disk Caching:
Implemented to store images on disk, reducing the need for repetitive network requests.
Uses a caching mechanism to manage disk space and optimize retrieval time.

Image Loading:
Asynchronously loads images in each cell of the UICollectionView.
Ensures smooth scrolling by offloading image download and cache management to the background.

Technologies Used
Swift: Core programming language.
UIKit: For UI components and UICollectionView.
URLSession: Handles network requests and manages image downloads.
Disk Caching: Custom caching using FileManager or third-party libraries like SDWebImage for enhanced disk caching.

Project Structure

Model:
Contains only a data struct representing media data, which is then utilized by the ViewModel.

DiskCache:
Handles all disk operations related to caching, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of media files from disk.

ImageCache:
Manages in-memory caching for images, improving loading performance and reducing the need for repeated disk access.

MediaService:
Centralized service to handle media-related data, including fetching and preparing data for the ViewModel.

View:
Contains the UICollectionView and cell configurations, responsible for displaying images and handling UI interactions.

ViewModel:
Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, managing data flow, image fetching, and caching logic.
Integrates DiskCache, ImageCache, and MediaService to provide efficient data to the View, enabling smooth image loading and caching.

Optimization Opportunities

Implement Prefetching in UICollectionView:
Enable prefetching of images in the UICollectionView for smoother scrolling and minimized delay in loading images.
This feature will use UICollectionViewDataSourcePrefetching to load images for upcoming cells in advance.

Background Data Fetching:
Perform periodic background data updates to keep cached data fresh, improving the user experience with updated content.

Asynchronous Image Decoding:
Offload image decoding to background threads to reduce the main thread workload, resulting in smoother UI performance.

How to Run the Project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Xcode.
Build and run on a simulator or physical device.
